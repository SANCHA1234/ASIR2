                            <p>This activity consists of making a database with the app that's called sqlite, with his tables and users and his respectful users and tables. 
                                In addition, we had to make a backup of the database and enable the automatization of backups. And later answer a couple of questions without
                                chatgpt related to the settings of the database. I give a mark of 6 because it's similar to the previous.

                                I learnt the command “crontab -e” wich let you automatize the backups and create index which let you create an index with the most information 
                                that users searched.

                            <p>This activity consists of making a database with the app that's called PostgreSQL, with his tables and users and his respectful users and tables.
                                 Normally we use the terminal with commands to make it. But  in this case, we also used the graphical interface, using a socket. 
                                 And later we make tables with special columns using JSON and array, wich let you make more dates.

                                I give a mark of 8 because we used a graphical view for making databases and I learnt how to do it. I learnt how to install the graphical interface and how to used it.

                            <p>This activity consists of making a database with the app that's called mysql, first we had to create the tables and the users.
                                  Later we did references between the tables, because they are relationated with his id. Although, With the users we have to 
                                  grant permissions like select or update for let them make changes in the tables. These activity was entertaining and i valorated with a 8.

                                I learnt the command “Flush Privileges” which you use when you make a change in the table of users, so the change is permanent and “Drop User” it is usually for deleting a user..

                            <p>This activity consists of looking for the meaning of the settings for Databases, which let you adjust and change it. 
                                In addition, it is important to know what do ever parameter, for adjust the database for the specifications of the customer. 
                                It was a little complicated,  because i didn´t know any, so I had to make an effort to  learn it. I put these activity a 9,
                                because now I know more about databases.
