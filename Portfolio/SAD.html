                            <p>In this activity, we had to do an attack in our computer to another user and for a webpage. First we make  a dictionary
                                 mixing letters and numbers with the tools  pydictor and dymerge, later we enable ssh with let us to to the attack and
                                  in the end we use hydra for attack, this tool force the password testing with all of the possibilities, until it 
                                  found the password of the user and the webpgage.

                                I give a mark of 6 because it was so hard to attack the webpage, because we make the webpage before for attack it. I learnt the ways that hackers attack and some tools.

                            <p>In this activity we made users which we grant and revoke permissions, for learning how linux manages the permissions of users and administrators.
                                 We made directories and files for testing. Later we test some commands for finding files if we don't know where they are kept.
                                This activity was longer than another's, but i think that is useful the commands that show you where the files are kept.
                                
                                I learnt the command “touch” for creating files and “mkdir” for creating directories for keep the files.

                                know before. 

                                I learnt what is a drive by download that happens when you access a link that is not secure and the other is Ramsonware 
                                that you can infected downloading a email, this malware encrypt your computer and you have to pay for the password.

                            <p>In this activity we had to make a webpage with an user and his passwords, to hack it and later we had to implement upgrades for evit it.
                                 We made a database with the users and his respective passwords.

                                I give a mark of 7 because it was great how to prevent simple attacks with simple solutions and i learnt. With this activity I discovered 
                                flask, which is an extra tool  of python which lets you make webpages and the easier way to hack a page only with the admin user.

                                tools explain if our ip address is secure or if our dates are locked or if they were stolen. I learnt the tool 
                                virtualping hos function is for know if a web changes his content for possible frauds and the tool url crazy 
                                for detected fake url's.

                                I give a mark of 8 because it was cool know more about this tools for our security.
